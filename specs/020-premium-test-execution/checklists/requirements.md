# Specification Quality Checklist: Premium Test Execution Page

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-02
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Spec references existing design patterns (AnimatedPageHeader, TestStatusBadge) by name but does not prescribe implementation approach
- Four user stories cover header consistency (P1), status indicators (P1), animations (P2), and colored accents (P2)
- Edge cases address long text, rapid completions, navigation caching, and binding failures
- Out of scope clearly defines boundaries with other features (019-premium-buttons)
